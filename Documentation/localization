Localization
============

kupfer is translated using gettext and it is managed in the build system
using intltool. Translation messages are located in the po/ directory.

To update an existing translation
---------------------------------

To update with new strings, run:
./waf intlupdate

Then check all fuzzy messages, translate all untranslated messages.
Contrinue running ./waf intlupdate to check that you have 0 fuzzy and 0
untranslated, then you're finished.

Add only the file you changed with
git add po/lang.po
git commit -m "lang: Updated translation"

where 'lang' is the two-letter abbreviation


To create a new translation
---------------------------

Add the language to po/LINGUAS with it's (commonly) two-letter code.
Run ./waf intlupdate and then edit the header in the po/lang.po file,
filling in your name and other slots, and importantly the CHARSET. You
probably want to use UTF-8.

When the header is filled-in, run ./waf intlupdate to see that it runs
without errors, and you should have a po/lang.po file ready for
translating.

To try the new translation
--------------------------

Make sure the translation is listed in po/LINGUAS.

To try it, you have to install kupfer with ./waf install

If you run ./kupfer-activate.sh from the working directory it won't find
the installed translations unless you make a symlink called 'locale' to
the installed location (for example ~/.local/share/locale if install
prefix was ~/.local).
