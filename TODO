Some very loose planning

* We can use signals to keep certain sources up-to-date, that's at least
  the case for Recently used items. Places can trivially be checked
  manually. Wich caching in Leaf and dynamically changing the result of
  is_dynamic, we can pull this through pretty smoohtly.
* We should make Leaf objects comparable/hashable and keep only one of each
  thing from different sources. This logic should partly be in Leaf and
  partly in MultiSource.

Quicksilverish ideas that might be reachable

* Drop on the Kupfer pane to interact with current objects
* The comma trick
* Learning
