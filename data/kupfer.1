\fBkupfer\fR [OPTIONS]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Kupfer is a launcher. You do not primarily use it to search your files, you use
it to summon the object you are thinking about.

Kupfer is written using Python and has a flexible architecture. It can work
with applications and files, recent documents and web browser bookmarks, and
many more types of user data.

The philosophy of Kupfer is simplicity. The implementation is simple, makes
the easy things work first, and does not overimplement unnecessary parts of
the program.

If the keybinder module is installed, kupfer will listen to a keybinding. By
default the keybinding is <Control>space, but it can be configured.

.SH "CUSTOMIZATION"
kupfer's \-\-help option will give information about how to configure kupfer's
plugin use and other options.

Custom plugins are added to kupfer by installing them to the directory
~/.local/share/kupfer/plugins, or any kupfer/plugins directory in any of
XDG_DATA_DIRS.
