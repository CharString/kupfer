.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Kupfer is a launcher. You do not primarily use it to search your files, you use
it to summon the object you are thinking about.

Kupfer is written using Python and has a flexible architecture. It can work
with applications and files, recent documents and web browser bookmarks, and
many more types of user data.

The philosophy of Kupfer is simplicity. The implementation is simple, makes
the easy things work first, and does not overimplement unnecessary parts of
the program.

.SH "SPAWNING"
Running kupfer on the command line (without options) will try to summon it if
already running.  

If the keybinder module is installed, kupfer will listen to a keybinding. By
default the keybinding is <Control>space to focus kupfer.

Kupfer can be invoked with a text query, with
.IP
