Installing
==========
This project is configured for waf; waf is shipped in the
distributable tarball but not in the repository.
If you need to get waf, run::

    wget -O waf http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.5.8
    chmod +x waf

Installation follows the steps::

    ./waf configure --prefix=PREFIX
    ./waf

then::

    ./waf install

or ::

    sudo ./waf install

here ``PREFIX`` assigns an installation spot. For all users,
programs are normally installed with prefix as ``/usr/local``.
Installing only for your user, the prefix ``~/.local`` is often
used; you just have to check that:
``~/.local/bin`` is in your ``$PATH``
``~/.local/lib/python2.*/site-packages`` is in python's sys.path
(if not, you can add it by setting ``$PYTHONPATH``)

Spawning
========
Kupfer is installed as ``kupfer`` into ``$PREFIX/bin``.

Keybinder Module
----------------

Kupfer uses tomboy's keybinder code, just like many other
applications do for global keybindings.
I had to break out the python wrapping of the code into a
standalone python module `keybinder`_ that you need to install
first:

.. _`keybinder`: http://kaizer.se/wiki/python-keybinder

Now you can set kupfer's keybinding by editing kupfer's config.
See ``kupfer --help`` for how to do that.

You can use kupfer without the keybinder module, for example
by assigning a global keybinding to the ``kupfer`` binary; it is
not recommended.
