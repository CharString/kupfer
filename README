INSTALLING
==========
This project is configured for waf; waf is shipped in the
distributable tarball but not in the repository.
If you need to get waf, run:

    wget -O waf http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.5.8
    chmod +x waf

Installation follows the steps
    ./waf configure --prefix=PREFIX
    ./waf install

here `PREFIX` assigns an installation spot. For all users,
programs are normally installed with prefix as /usr/local.
Installing only for your user, the prefix ~/.local is often
used; you just have to check that
`~/.local/bin` is in your $PATH
`~/.local/lib/python2.*/site-packages` is in python's sys.path
(if not, you can add it by setting $PYTHONPATH)

SPAWNING
========
Kupfer is installed as `kupfer` into $PREFIX/bin.

There is no need to build global keyboard shortcut support into
kupfer -- just assign a global shortcut to `kupfer` using
existing means, [such as in metacity][ky]. I recommend using the
shortcut `<Ctrl>space` but you can choose whatever suits your
needs.
