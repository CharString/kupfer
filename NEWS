NEWS for kupfer
===============

kupfer version c14
------------------

* Rewrite and improve browsing mode:
  * Browsing the catalog or folders is much improved; it is easier to keep the
    overview and be oriented.
  * Returning to kupfer after having performed an action, the old object is
    still available, but without locking the catalog to its location.
    When spawning kupfer again, the previous context is available if you
    immediately browse; if you search, you search the whole catalog.
  * The search times out after 2 seconds if no key is typed. Now the highlight
    text will fade to show this.
* Add accelerators `Ctrl+G` and `Ctrl+T` to get current selection in nautilus
  and currently selected text (if available).

kupfer version c13.1
------------------

* Fix two bugs with _Rename To..._ 

kupfer version c13
------------------

* New Plugin: Calculator

  Catch SIGINT without python's handler, _Copy To..._ requires pygobject 2.18
  now)

  better.
* Other improvements.

This release is localized in: Swedish (100%), Italian (60%)

kupfer version c9

  new functions. Type period `.` to enter free-text mode (just like in QS).

This release is localized in: Swedish (100%), Italian (60%)

* Apply interface polish (proper english capitalization of actions and
  other objects, other changes)

  either install `xdg-terminal` or symlink it to their terminal program)
* Allow unbinding the keybinding

kupfer version c7
-----------------

The "choice" release

This is a followup with some small changes after the c6 release, which
introduced lots of major changes, including a preferences window and
"application content."

* Allow wnck to be optional. Kupfer needs wnck to do application matching
  and focusing of already running applications, but can now run without it if
  wnck is not available. Window List plugin also needs wnck
* Rhythmbox plugin should not crash even if library is not found, now kupfer
  can run even if rhythmbox's files are not there.
* Applications will match names as well as the executables, so that "gedit"
  matches Text Editor regardless of what the displayed localized name is.

kupfer version c6
-----------------

The "Sisyphus incremental improvements" release

* Preferences window
  * Allows setting keybinding on the fly
  * List and enable/disable plugins and set plugin options
* Everything was improved slightly, but steadily
* Understands more applications, provides more files and objects,
  and actions with **new plugins:** *Rhythmbox, Abiword, Clipboards, Dictionary,
  Favorites, Selected Text, Wikipedia*
* Connect applications with their related object sources and make it their
  content, such as Rhythmbox music for the Rhythmbox application.
  * Applications contain their recently used documents, if
    available.
  * Firefox and Epiphany bookmarks are identified with each application
* Miscellaneous improvements:
  * Kupfer object icon ("blue box")
  * _Some_ default application associations are installed (others
    are learned by launching applications).
  * Experimental UI with two-line title+description in browse mode
  * Thumbnails for files and albums in browse mode
  * Allow sending files and queries to kupfer from the commandline
    using `kupfer 'query'` or `kupfer docs/file.pdf`.
  * Even more plugins listen to change callbacks or filesystem monitors
    to be up to date to the instant.
  * Do not display nonexisting files as results
  * Fine-tune how sources are loaded and refreshed on load

This release deserves lots of testing. [File bug reports and feature
requests.][bug] Read the files in `Documentation/` and see how you can add
new plugins with object and application knowledge to kupfer.

This release is localized in: Swedish (100%), Italian (60%)

Future: part 2 of beautification is refactoring of the interface, so
that the UI can be modularized and exchanged in plugins.

kupfer version c5
-----------------

The "Beauty from the inside, part 1" release

* Big refactorings of the whole data model
  * Move all of the data model to kupfer.data
  * Allow actions with indirect objects "threepane kupfer" (with
    means to configure which objects to use for an action etc)
  * Uses unicode internally, instead of UTF-8-encoded strings
* Some new actions using new possibilities (Open with any, Move file
  to new location, Add/Remove tracker tags) but more is possible.
* Basic manual page included
* Fileactions plugin includes unpack archive/create archive
* Ship extra and demonstration plugins in contrib/ and interals
  documentation in Documentation/
* Change learning algorithm to recognize an item's type as well
  (so that two objects named "project" can be ranked differently)
* Small fixes (alphabethic sorting for applications, sources, check
  if objects still exist after an action, rank_adjust default actions
  slightly)

This release deserves lots of testing. File bug reports and feature
requests. Read the files in Documentation/ and see how you can add
new plugins with object and application knowledge to kupfer.
