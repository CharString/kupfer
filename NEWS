NEWS for kupfer
===============

kupfer version c5
-----------------

The "Beauty from the inside, part 1" release

* Big refactorings of the whole data model
  * Move all of the data model to kupfer.data
  * Allow actions with indirect objects "threepane kupfer" (with
    means to configure which objects to use for an action etc)
  * Uses unicode internally, instead of UTF-8-encoded strings
* Some new actions using new possibilities (Open with any, Move file
  to new location, Add/Remove tracker tags) but more is possible.
* Basic manual page included
* Fileactions plugin includes unpack archive/create archive
* Ship extra and demonstration plugins in contrib/ and interals
  documentation in Documentation/
* Change learning algorithm to recognize an item's type as well
  (so that two objects named "project" can be ranked differently)
* Small fixes (alphabethic sorting for applications, sources, check
  if objects still exist after an action, rank_adjust default actions
  slightly)

This release deserves lots of testing. File bug reports and feature
requests. Read the files in Documentation/ and see how you can add
new plugins with object and application knowledge to kupfer.

This release is localized in: Swedish (100%), Italian (80%)

Future: part 2 of beautification is refactoring of the interface, so
that the UI can be exchanged. And preferences will hopefully be implemented
