  <title>How to configure plugins</title>

  <p>
    Functionality in Kupfer is organized by extentsion modules called
    "plugins". Each plugin provides additional functionality, for example
    integration with an external application.
  </p>

  <section>
    <title>Configuring Plugins</title>
    <p>
      You can enable, disable and configure plugins if you open Kupfer's
      preferences window using one of these methods:
    </p>
    <list>
      <item><p>Click the Kupfer icon in the notification area and select
        the item Preferences</p>
      </item>
      <item><p>Search for the object <app>Kupfer Preferences</app> in Kupfer itself.
            Press <key>Return</key> to open it.</p>
      </item>
      <item><p>Use the keyboard shortcut
          <keyseq><key>Control</key><key>;</key></keyseq></p>
      </item>
    </list>
    <p>
      Select the tab "Plugins" to reach the plugin list in the
      preferences window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Select plugins in the list to read about them, and tick the box
      next its name to load the plugin.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the plugin has any configurable parameters, they will be
      visible below the plugin information.
    </p>
    <p>The plugin <app>Kupfer Plugins</app> allows fast access to each plugin's
      information page as well as the action "Show Source Code" which
      reveals the implementation.
    </p>

    <title>Installing more Plugins</title>
    <p>
      You can install custom plugins into the folder
      <code>~/.local/share/kupfer/plugins</code>. Each plugin is either a
      single <code>.py</code> file or a python package (a folder directly
      containing a file called <code>__init__.py</code>). Plugins
      in the package format can include icon files. Python packages can even
      be installed as <code>.zip</code> files.
    </p>

    <title>Creating Plugins</title>
    <p>
      Adding to <app>Kupfer</app>'s object knowledge can be surprisingly
      easy, just look at the default plugins if you want to create new.
      Documentation for plugin creators is available in the file
      Documentation/Manual.rst in the source distribution on the webpage at
      <link href="http://kaizer.se/wiki/kupfer/Manual/">Kupfer Manual</link>.

  <section>
    <title>The <em>Catalog</em> tab in preferences</title>
    <p>
      Each plugin can export a number of sources which contain objects.
      Normally, all their contents are directly accessible from a top-level
      search.
      Some plugins export so specialized or so many objects that their
      catalogs should better not have their objects exported to the top
      level. To reach those objects, you have to first find the catalog by
      name, then enter the catalog using the action <em>Search
        Contents</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tab <em>Catalog</em> in <app>Kupfer Preferences</app>, 
      a ticked box next to each source means that its objects are exported.
      An unticked box means that its contents are hidden from the top level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> Kupfer may become slow if large enough subcatalogs are exported
      to the top level.
