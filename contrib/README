contrib
=======

A place to put contributed plugins that can serve as examples, even
though they might not be enabled for release or installed by default

The plugins here can't be guaranteed to be compatible with the current
release, it might be that changes to the main code makes them
incomptible.

Custom plugins (like these) should be installed into
~/.local/share/kupfer/plugins
